# TuLiP_examples

Simple examples to learn how to use TuLiP to synthesize controllers and finite state machines

Singlelane example:
A car is driving along a single lane without any environment input
- singlelane.py
- ctrl_singlelane.png (synthesized controller)

Singlelane_signal:
A car is driving along the single lane, but a location X2 a traffic light is located, which makes the car stop on red
- singlelane_signal.py
- singlelane_signal.png (synthesized controller)
- singlelane_signal_fsm.py (FSM for this example generated by TuLiP)
- example_fsm.py (running this script gives the FSM for this example for the choice of environment action)

Intersection Example:
- Car driving through an intersection and turning left
- Environment is the traffic signal (red or !red) and if the path is clear (!notclear or clear)
- intersection.py
-  intersection_signal.png (synthesized controller)
- intersection_signal_fsm.py (FSM for this example generated by TuLiP)
- fsm_for_intersection.py (running this script gives the FSM as a list depending on environment variable choice)

Gridworlds:
- grid_singlelane.py is the same ad singlelane.py example but set up as a gridworld in TuLiP
- grid_singlelane_signal.py attempt of singlelane_signal.py in a grid world - not completed yet
